# AI (CS5260) - Class Project

A multi-method AI agent that plans and models trading and development (e.g., farming, manufacturing) decisions for a set of virtual countries, with each country possessing virtual resources and incentives for cooperating and competing with other countries. It uses a forward-searching, utility-driven, depth-bounded search, utility-driven scheduler.

It can be tweaked to adjust how much trading is done between each country, and impose things like tariffs and trade embargos. A carbon footprint can also be taken into account. See `expected_utility.py`.

Details: 
- Schedules of assignments are generated for transforms and transfers of resources, and a search strategy was implemented to find the best schedules, maximizing the state quality for a country. 
- I used a best-first search algorithm which uses a priority queue sorted by expected utility to keep track of the best schedules found so far, with a depth-bound limit, to limit the search depth.
- A state quality function is used to evaluate world states, initially and as they are changed by applying the schedules. 
- A successor function is used to generate possible actions the agent can search through, respecting a maximum frontier size, and a maximum number of best schedules to keep. It then performs the search and maintains a list of the best_schedules to be able to return the best one at any given time (anytime search). 
* The expected utility pipeline includes equations and functions to calculate the expected utility of partial resource schedules including:
    * Discounted reward
    * Gamma - discount factor that determines the importance of future rewards relative to immediate rewards.
    * Probability of acceptance
    * x0 
    * Constants K and l are used to adjust impact of resources weights and proportions on state quality 
    * Gamma - discount factor that determines the importance of future rewards relative to immediate rewards
    * Failure cost - const_c

## Running 

Run `pip3 install && python3 main.py`

The agent terminates when the frontier reaches the set maximum size. 

## Resources, Weights, Initial World State

Resources
- `resource-weights.csv` - defines resource weights 
- `resource-proportions.csv` - is to define the proportion of resource each person gets
- `resource-weights--energy.csv` - defines resource weights with energy resources added

Initial World States
- `initial-world-state.csv` - default world state
- `initial-world-state--energy.csv` - world state where a lot of potential energy is handed out to see how that affects things 

# Additional Experiments

- Working in a type of GDP calculation of a country based on trade, money and labor into a state quality function. Then I was trying to add in tariffs to see what would happen. I could also add in things like a trade embargo. This setup would also allow adding trade balances and deficits between countries, a currency exchange rate, and adding in all kinds of country-based economic metrics.

- Working in a carbon_footprint property into another state quality function. I would like to eventually mess around with giving different countries different state quality functions like these, and see how they do when maximized for economic growth vs environmental sustainability.
