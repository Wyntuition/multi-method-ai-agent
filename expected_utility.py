    State quality function:
    - substantially dependent on countries resources
    - in our world, we have land, and potential fossil and renewable energy so we can model how impactful these things are in the state function
    - One way: weighted sum of resource factors (wRi * cRi * ARi/AP population)
        - wRi * cRi * ARi/AP population - land, fossil energy, renewable energy
    - Backed up by factors:

    INPUTS: state, schedule, resource weights

    PROCESSING: State quality for each country: For each resource, run through state value function and aggregate the values

    Psudocode:
    for each country:
        for each resource:
            resource weight = get resource weight from resource-weights.csv
            calculate state quality:
                state quality = wRi * cRi * ARi / A_Population, where
                    - wRi = resource weight
                    - cRi = proportion constant 
                    - ARi = resource amount
                    - A_Population = population of country
